## Getting started

This app can be installed in one click via the Umbrel App Store. Watch the introduction and demo video below:

[![Introducing Nostr Relay on Umbrel](https://i.imgur.com/kv3QVs4.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjNa1MKvdrs "Introducing Nostr Relay on Umbrel")

By running your personal Nostr Relay on your Umbrel, you can connect your Nostr clients, such as Damus, Astral, and Amethyst, to your private relay for seamless backup of all your activity on Nostr. This ensures that your activity is not lost even if you are censored or blocked by public relays.

In Damus, go to Settings > Relays to add your Relay URL.

> Tip: Install Tailscale on your Umbrel and your devices for an uninterrupted connection between your clients and your relay, even when you're away from your home network. Enable Tailscale's MagicDNS and use ws://umbrel:4848 as your Relay URL.

Nostr Relay is powered by the open source [nostr-rs-relay](https://github.com/scsibug/nostr-rs-relay) project — a Rust implementation of Nostr relay. It currently supports the entire relay protocol, including NIP-01, NIP-02, NIP-03, NIP-05, NIP-09, NIP-11, NIP-12, NIP-15, NIP-16, NIP-20, NIP-22, NIP-26, NIP-28, and NIP-33.
